Just for fun, for now:

```rust
splog_debug!("This is a debug message.");
splog_info!("This is an info message.");
splog_warn!("This is a warning message.");
splog_error!("This is an error message.");
splog_critical!("This is a critical message.");
```

```shell
Program Log: [DEBUG]: This is a debug message.
Program Log: [INFO]: This is an info message.
Program Log: [WARN]: This is a warning message.
Program Log: [ERROR]: This is an error message.
Program Log: [CRITICAL]: This is a critical message.
```
